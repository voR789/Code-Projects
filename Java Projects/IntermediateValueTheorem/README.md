**In basic calculus, students learn about IVT, or intermediate value theorem. This states that within a continuous interval of a function,
[a,b], any number between f(a) and f(b) is guaranteed to be a value on the function. How can this be applied in real life?
One such function is by finding the root of a function throughout an interval. By receiving negative and positive bounds left and right of a
root within a function, by binary searching for where it strikes zero (guaranteed by IVT), you can find the root of a function.**
So bascially: *Digitalize polynomial function -> Enter left and right bound around root -> use binary search to find approximation of root*
This is similar to the programs used in TI-84 Calculators to solve roots
